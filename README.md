# autohotkeys

## how to use
Check out the repo
have windows autorun PilotLight.ahk
add shortcuts??



## Architecture

"properties" are hardcoded for each machine. do not check it.

pilot light starts everything.

engine script manages all 'quality of life stuff', ie...
sending emails, un, pw,


## Debugging
ctrl win alt and D to open debugger 


## features to add

make f9 cycle through keyboard types
make F9 create a GUI instead of a bunch of keys



## tech debt
aoei

remove if thens and just run a home computer script and a work computer script depending on comp name.


pilot light will need to use the repo root to find the other scripts, for now, search replace is working okay for machine port


values everywhere, must consolidate
